# Infrastructure Layer Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring changes made to the Infrastructure Layer of the AutoQliq application. The refactoring focused on improving the repository implementations to better adhere to SOLID, KISS, and DRY principles.

## Changes Made

### 1. Repository Base Class Enhancements

- Added abstract methods for CRUD operations:

  - `save(entity_id, entity)`: Save an entity to the repository
  - `get(entity_id)`: Get an entity from the repository
  - `delete(entity_id)`: Delete an entity from the repository
  - `list()`: List all entity IDs in the repository

- Added validation and error handling:

  - `_validate_entity_id(entity_id)`: Validate entity IDs
  - `_log_operation(operation, entity_id)`: Log repository operations

- Improved documentation for all methods

### 2. DatabaseRepository Base Class Enhancements

- Implemented abstract methods from Repository base class
- Added transaction support with context manager:
  - `transaction()`: Context manager for database transactions
- Improved error handling with domain-specific exceptions
- Added template methods for entity operations:
  - `_save_entity(entity_id, entity)`: Template method for saving entities
  - `_get_entity(entity_id)`: Template method for retrieving entities
  - `_delete_entity(entity_id)`: Template method for deleting entities
  - `_list_entities()`: Template method for listing entities

### 3. FileSystemRepository Base Class Enhancements

- Implemented abstract methods from Repository base class
- Improved error handling with domain-specific exceptions
- Added template methods for entity operations:
  - `_save_entity(entity_id, entity)`: Template method for saving entities
  - `_get_entity(entity_id)`: Template method for retrieving entities
  - `_delete_entity(entity_id)`: Template method for deleting entities
  - `_list_entities()`: Template method for listing entities

### 4. RepositoryFactory Enhancements

- Improved error handling with domain-specific exceptions
- Updated documentation to reflect changes

### 5. Credential Repository Implementations

- Added missing `list_credentials()` method to FileSystemCredentialRepository
- Added missing `list_credentials()` method to DatabaseCredentialRepository

### 6. Exception Handling

- Added new exception classes:
  - `RepositoryError`: For repository-related errors
  - `SerializationError`: For serialization-related errors

## Testing

Comprehensive tests were created for all components:

- Repository base class tests
- DatabaseRepository base class tests
- FileSystemRepository base class tests
- RepositoryFactory tests

All tests are passing, ensuring that the refactored code works as expected.

## SOLID Principles Compliance

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- Each repository class has a single responsibility: managing a specific type of entity
- Base classes provide common functionality, while concrete implementations handle specific entity types
- Helper methods are used to break down complex operations

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- Base classes are designed to be extended without modification
- Template methods allow for customization of behavior in subclasses

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- All repository implementations can be used interchangeably through their interfaces
- Base class contracts are respected by all subclasses

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- Interfaces are focused and minimal
- Each interface method serves a specific purpose

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- RepositoryFactory provides a way to create repositories without depending on concrete implementations

## Next Steps

1. Apply similar refactoring to other parts of the Infrastructure Layer
2. Update the UI Layer to use the refactored repositories
3. Create integration tests to ensure everything works together correctly
