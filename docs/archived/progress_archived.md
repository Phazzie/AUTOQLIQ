# AutoQliq Implementation Progress Checklist

## Phase 2: Infrastructure Layer Implementation

This checklist tracks the implementation progress of the Infrastructure Layer phase, strictly adhering to Test-Driven Development (TDD), SOLID principles, Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS), and Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) methodologies.

**Note:** Phase 1 (Core Domain Model) has been completed and archived in `progress_phase1_archived.md`.

### Principles Compliance Tracking

#### TDD Compliance

- [ ] All components follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- [ ] Tests are written before implementation code
- [ ] Tests verify behavior, not implementation details
- [ ] Refactoring is performed after tests pass
- [ ] Test coverage exceeds 90% for all components

#### SOLID Compliance

- [ ] **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has only one reason to change
- [ ] **Open/Closed Principle**: Components are extendable without modification
- [ ] **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes are substitutable for their base types
- [ ] **Interface Segregation Principle**: Interfaces are client-specific, not general-purpose
- [ ] **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules depend on abstractions

#### KISS Compliance

- [ ] All implementations use the simplest possible solution
- [ ] No premature optimization or unnecessary complexity
- [ ] Clear, straightforward naming conventions
- [ ] Methods are short and focused (â‰¤20 lines)
- [ ] Classes have minimal responsibilities

#### DRY Compliance

- [ ] No duplicated code across components
- [ ] Shared functionality is extracted to common utilities
- [ ] Inheritance and composition are used appropriately
- [ ] Single source of truth for all concepts
- [ ] Configuration is centralized
