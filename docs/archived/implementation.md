# AutoQliq Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation strategy for the AutoQliq application, a web automation tool built with Python, Selenium, and Tkinter. The implementation will strictly adhere to Test-Driven Development (TDD), SOLID principles, Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS), and Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) methodologies to ensure a robust, maintainable, and extensible codebase.

## Core Principles

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

All implementation will follow the TDD cycle:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test that defines the expected behavior
2. **Green**: Implement the minimum code necessary to pass the test
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while ensuring tests continue to pass

Benefits of this approach:

- Ensures code correctness from the start
- Provides immediate feedback on design decisions
- Creates a comprehensive test suite that serves as living documentation
- Prevents regression issues during future development

### SOLID Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- Each class will have one and only one reason to change
- Example: Separate `WebDriverAdapter` from `ActionExecutor`

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Example: `ActionFactory` will allow new action types without modifying existing code

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- Example: All `Action` implementations must fulfill the `IAction` contract

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use
- Example: Separate `IWorkflowRepository` from `ICredentialRepository`

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions
- Example: `WorkflowRunner` will depend on `IWebDriver` interface, not concrete Selenium implementation

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- Favor simplicity over complexity
- Implement the simplest solution that satisfies requirements
- Avoid premature optimization
- Use clear naming conventions and straightforward implementations

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Extract common functionality into reusable components
- Use inheritance and composition appropriately
- Implement shared utilities for cross-cutting concerns
- Maintain single sources of truth for all concepts

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Domain Model

#### Step 1: Define Core Interfaces

1. **Write Tests**:

   - Test interface contracts through mock implementations
   - Verify interface completeness for domain requirements

2. **Implement Interfaces**:

   ```python
   # Example interface definition
   class IAction(ABC):
       @abstractmethod
       def execute(self, web_driver: IWebDriver) -> ActionResult:
           """Execute the action using the provided web driver."""
           pass
   ```

3. **Key Interfaces**:
   - `IWebDriver`: Abstraction over browser automation
   - `IAction`: Contract for all workflow actions
   - `IWorkflowRepository`: Storage and retrieval of workflows
   - `ICredentialRepository`: Secure storage of credentials

#### Step 2: Implement Domain Entities

1. **Write Tests**:

   - Test entity behavior and validation
   - Verify entity relationships

2. **Implement Entities**:
   - `Credential`: Username/password pair with name identifier
   - `Workflow`: Collection of ordered actions
   - `ActionResult`: Success/failure status with messages

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Layer

#### Step 1: Implement WebDriver Adapter

1. **Write Tests**:

   - Test WebDriver initialization
   - Test navigation, element finding, and interaction methods
   - Test error handling and recovery

     - `NavigateAction`
     - `ClickAction`
     - `TypeAction`
     - `WaitAction`
     - `ScreenshotAction`
     - `SelectAction`

3. **Implement ActionFactory**:
   - Create factory to instantiate actions from configuration
   - Support extensibility for future action types

#### Step 2: Implement WorkflowRunner

1. **Write Tests**:

   - Test workflow execution
   - Test error handling and recovery
   - Test reporting

2. **Implement Runner**:
   - Create `WorkflowRunner` to orchestrate action execution
   - Implement progress tracking
   - Add error handling with recovery options

### Phase 4: Application Services

#### Step 1: Implement Application Services

1. **Write Tests**:

   - Test coordination between UI and core logic
   - Test error handling and user feedback

2. **Implement Services**:
   - Create `WorkflowExecutionService` to run workflows
   - Create `WorkflowManagementService` to create/edit workflows
   - Implement `CredentialManagementService` for credential operations

### Phase 5: User Interface

#### Step 1: Implement Presenters

1. **Write Tests**:

   - Test presenter logic
   - Test UI state management
   - Test user interaction handling

2. **Implement Presenters**:
   - Create `EditorPresenter` for workflow editing
   - Create `RunnerPresenter` for workflow execution
   - Implement event handling and UI state management

#### Step 2: Implement Views

1. **Write Tests**:

   - Test view rendering
   - Test user input handling

2. **Implement Views**:
   - Create `EditorView` using Tkinter
   - Create `RunnerView` using Tkinter
   - Implement responsive UI with proper feedback

#### Step 3: Implement Main Application

1. **Write Tests**:

   - Test application initialization
   - Test dependency injection

2. **Implement Application**:
   - Create main application entry point
   - Set up dependency injection
   - Initialize UI components

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Test each class in isolation
- Use mocks for dependencies
- Aim for >90% code coverage
- Test both happy paths and error conditions

### Integration Testing

- Test interactions between components
- Focus on repository, web driver, and workflow execution
- Use test doubles for external dependencies

### End-to-End Testing

- Test complete workflows
- Verify UI functionality
- Test with real browser instances (headless for CI)

### Test Organization
