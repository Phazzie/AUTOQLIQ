# AutoQliq Implementation Guide

This document outlines the implementation approach, architecture, and development roadmap for the AutoQliq application.

## 1. Architecture Overview

AutoQliq follows a clean, layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### 1.1 Core Layer
- **Domain Model**: Defines the core entities and business logic
- **Interfaces**: Establishes contracts for all components
- **Actions**: Implements executable steps for workflows
- **Workflow**: Manages execution flow and context

### 1.2 Infrastructure Layer
- **WebDrivers**: Implements browser automation (Selenium, Playwright)
- **Repositories**: Handles data persistence (File System, Database)
- **Common Utilities**: Provides shared functionality

### 1.3 Application Layer
- **Services**: Orchestrates use cases and business logic
- **Security**: Manages authentication and credential protection

### 1.4 UI Layer
- **Views**: Implements user interface components (Tkinter)
- **Presenters**: Handles UI logic and state management
- **Dialogs**: Provides specialized UI interactions

## 2. Development Principles

### 2.1 Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests before implementation (Red phase)
- Implement minimal code to pass tests (Green phase)
- Refactor while maintaining passing tests (Refactor phase)
- Maintain high test coverage (>90% target)

### 2.2 SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Extend behavior without modifying existing code
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on unused methods
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations

### 2.3 KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- Keep methods short (â‰¤20 lines)
- Use clear, descriptive naming
- Avoid premature optimization

### 2.4 DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract common functionality to shared utilities
- Use inheritance and composition appropriately
- Maintain single source of truth for all concepts

## 3. Implementation Roadmap

### 3.1 Phase 1: Core Domain Model (Completed)
- Define core interfaces (IAction, IWebDriver, IRepository)
- Implement basic actions (Navigate, Click, Type, Wait, Screenshot)
- Implement advanced actions (Conditional, Loop, ErrorHandling, Template)
- Create workflow runner with proper error handling
- Establish serialization/deserialization for all entities

### 3.2 Phase 2: Infrastructure Layer (In Progress)
- Implement Selenium WebDriver (Completed)
- Implement Playwright WebDriver (Functional, needs UI integration)
- Create file system repositories for workflows and credentials (Completed)
- Create database repositories for workflows and credentials (Completed)
- Implement repository factories and configuration (Completed)

### 3.3 Phase 3: Application Services (In Progress)
- Implement workflow service for managing workflows (Completed)
- Implement credential service with secure storage (Completed)
- Create WebDriver service for browser automation (Completed)
- Implement reporting service for execution logs (Completed)
- Develop scheduler service for automated execution (Basic implementation)

### 3.4 Phase 4: User Interface (In Progress)
- Create base view and presenter classes (Completed)
- Implement workflow editor view and presenter (Completed)
- Implement workflow runner view and presenter (Functional, needs Playwright integration)
- Create settings view and presenter (Functional, needs Playwright options)
- Develop specialized dialogs for actions and credentials (Completed)

### 3.5 Phase 5: Testing and Documentation (Ongoing)
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all components
- Create integration tests for component interactions
- Develop end-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Document API and architecture
- Create user guides and tutorials

## 4. Playwright Implementation

### 4.1 Current Status
- Core PlaywrightDriver class implements IWebDriver interface
- Basic functionality (navigation, element interaction) is implemented
- Advanced features (JavaScript execution, screenshots) are implemented
- Factory supports creating Playwright drivers
- Basic tests exist and pass

### 4.2 Next Steps
1. **UI Integration**
   - Add driver type selection in workflow runner UI
   - Create configuration options for Playwright in settings UI
   - Update WebDriverService to handle Playwright-specific options

2. **Feature Parity**
   - Ensure all IWebDriver methods are fully implemented
   - Add support for advanced Playwright features (network interception, etc.)
   - Create comprehensive tests for all functionality

3. **Documentation**
   - Update user documentation to include Playwright options
   - Create examples demonstrating Playwright-specific features
   - Document performance and compatibility considerations

## 5. UI Improvements

### 5.1 Current Status
- Basic MVP architecture is implemented
- Workflow editor and runner are functional
- Action editor dialog supports all action types

### 5.2 Next Steps
1. **Enhanced Action Selection**
   - Create visual action selection dialog
   - Group actions by category
   - Add descriptions and examples

2. **Improved Workflow Visualization**
   - Add visual representation of workflow structure
   - Implement drag-and-drop for action reordering
   - Create collapsible action groups

3. **Better Error Reporting**
   - Enhance error visualization in workflow runner
   - Add detailed error information and suggestions
   - Implement step-by-step debugging

## 6. Testing Strategy

### 6.1 Unit Testing
- Test each class in isolation with mocked dependencies
- Verify behavior, not implementation details
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Maintain high coverage for core components

### 6.2 Integration Testing
- Test interactions between components
- Verify repository operations with test databases
- Test WebDriver implementations against test sites
- Validate service-repository interactions

### 6.3 UI Testing
- Test presenter logic with mocked views
- Verify view-presenter interactions
- Test UI components with simulated user actions

## 7. Deployment and Distribution

### 7.1 Packaging
- Create standalone executable with PyInstaller
- Package dependencies and resources
- Generate installers for different platforms

### 7.2 Configuration
- Use config.ini for application settings
- Support environment-specific configurations
- Implement secure credential storage

### 7.3 Updates
- Implement version checking
- Support automatic updates
- Maintain backward compatibility

## 8. Conclusion

AutoQliq is being developed as a robust, maintainable application following best practices in software engineering. The modular architecture ensures that components can be developed, tested, and replaced independently. The focus on TDD, SOLID principles, and clean code creates a foundation for long-term sustainability and extensibility.

The current implementation provides a functional web automation tool with support for both Selenium and Playwright. Ongoing development will enhance the user interface, improve testing coverage, and add advanced features while maintaining the core principles of quality and maintainability.
