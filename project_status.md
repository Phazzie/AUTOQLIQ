# AutoQliq Project Status

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation and refactoring progress of the AutoQliq project, with a focus on Phase 2: Infrastructure Layer. It combines the previous tracking from `progress.md` and `refactor.md` into a single comprehensive document.

**Note:** Phase 1 (Core Domain Model) has been completed and archived in `progress_phase1_archived.md`.

**Archive Note:** Previous tracking documents have been archived in `docs/archived/progress_archived.md` and `docs/archived/refactor_archived.md`.

## Why We're Refactoring

The AutoQliq codebase has grown organically, leading to several architectural issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Violation of Single Responsibility Principle**: Many modules handle multiple concerns, making the code difficult to maintain and test.
2. **Tight Coupling**: Components are tightly coupled, making it difficult to replace or extend functionality.
3. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Error handling is inconsistent across the codebase.
4. **Limited Testability**: The current architecture makes it difficult to write comprehensive tests.
5. **Poor Separation of Concerns**: The layers of the application (UI, domain, infrastructure) are not clearly separated.

The goal of this refactoring is to create a clean, maintainable, and extensible codebase that follows SOLID principles, is easy to understand (KISS), and avoids duplication (DRY).

## Principles Compliance Tracking

### TDD Compliance

- [ ] All components follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- [ ] Tests are written before implementation code
- [ ] Tests verify behavior, not implementation details
- [ ] Refactoring is performed after tests pass
- [ ] Test coverage exceeds 90% for all components

### SOLID Compliance

- [ ] **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has only one reason to change
- [ ] **Open/Closed Principle**: Components are extendable without modification
- [ ] **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes are substitutable for their base types
- [ ] **Interface Segregation Principle**: Interfaces are client-specific, not general-purpose
- [ ] **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules depend on abstractions

### KISS Compliance

- [ ] All implementations use the simplest possible solution
- [ ] No premature optimization or unnecessary complexity
- [ ] Clear, straightforward naming conventions
- [ ] Methods are short and focused (â‰¤20 lines)
- [ ] Classes have minimal responsibilities

### DRY Compliance

- [ ] No duplicated code across components
- [ ] Shared functionality is extracted to common utilities
- [ ] Inheritance and composition are used appropriately
- [ ] Single source of truth for all concepts
- [ ] Configuration is centralized

### Honest and Fair Grading

**IMPORTANT**: All compliance evaluations must be honest and fair. Never claim compliance when violations exist. Each component should be evaluated against all principles with specific metrics:

- File sizes (flag files exceeding 200 lines)
- Method lengths (flag methods exceeding 20 lines)
- Class responsibilities (flag classes with more than one primary responsibility)
- Interface cohesion (flag interfaces with unrelated methods)

## Detailed Compliance Analysis

### SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:

   - **UI Layer**: 8/10 - Views and presenters have clear responsibilities, but some methods still do too much.
   - **Infrastructure Layer**: 6/10 - Repositories are better structured, but still handle too many concerns (serialization, validation, storage).
   - **Domain Layer**: 7/10 - Action classes are now separated by type, but some still handle multiple concerns.
   - **Application Layer**: 5/10 - Service classes need further refactoring to separate concerns.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:

   - **UI Layer**: 7/10 - Components can be extended, but some concrete dependencies remain.
   - **Infrastructure Layer**: 5/10 - New repository types can be added, but internal methods often need modification.
   - **Domain Layer**: 6/10 - Action hierarchy is extensible, but some base classes need modification for new features.
   - **Application Layer**: 5/10 - Services need better abstraction to allow extension without modification.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:

   - **UI Layer**: 8/10 - Subclasses generally respect contracts, but some assumptions about implementation details exist.
   - **Infrastructure Layer**: 7/10 - Repository interfaces are consistent, but some implementations add constraints.
   - **Domain Layer**: 7/10 - Action subclasses are substitutable, but some edge cases exist.
   - **Application Layer**: 6/10 - Service implementations sometimes violate interface contracts.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:

   - **UI Layer**: 6/10 - Some interfaces are too broad, forcing implementations to provide unnecessary methods.
   - **Infrastructure Layer**: 5/10 - Repository interfaces include methods that not all implementations need.
   - **Domain Layer**: 7/10 - Action interfaces are focused, but some could be further segregated.
   - **Application Layer**: 5/10 - Service interfaces need to be split into more focused interfaces.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - **UI Layer**: 7/10 - Presenters depend on abstractions, but some concrete dependencies remain.
   - **Infrastructure Layer**: 6/10 - Repositories depend on abstractions, but still have concrete dependencies.
   - **Domain Layer**: 7/10 - Actions depend on abstractions, but some concrete dependencies exist.
   - **Application Layer**: 5/10 - Services need better dependency injection.

### KISS Principle

1. **UI Layer**: 6/10

   - Some methods are still complex and difficult to understand
   - Error handling logic is sometimes convoluted
   - View creation and management is overly complex

2. **Infrastructure Layer**: 5/10

   - Repository implementations have complex error handling
   - Serialization logic is spread across multiple classes
   - Database operations are more complex than necessary

3. **Domain Layer**: 6/10

   - Some action classes have complex execution logic
   - Workflow runner has complex error handling
   - Credential management could be simplified

4. **Application Layer**: 5/10
   - Service implementations are often too complex
   - Configuration management needs simplification
   - Error handling patterns are inconsistent

### DRY Principle

1. **UI Layer**: 7/10

   - Common patterns are extracted to base classes
   - Some duplication remains in error handling and event management
   - View creation logic is duplicated across view classes

2. **Infrastructure Layer**: 6/10

   - Common repository operations are in base classes
   - Serialization logic is still partially duplicated
   - Error handling patterns are inconsistent

3. **Domain Layer**: 7/10

   - Common action behavior is in base classes
   - Some duplication in validation logic
   - Error handling could be more consistent

4. **Application Layer**: 5/10
   - Service implementations have duplicated patterns
   - Configuration handling has duplication
   - Error handling is inconsistent
