"""Serialization utilities for AutoQliq actions.

This module currently serves as a placeholder.
Serialization logic is handled by `ActionBase.to_dict()` methods
and deserialization by `ActionFactory.create_action()`.

Future enhancements could include dedicated serializer classes
or support for different serialization formats (e.g., JSON, YAML).
"""

# No code needed here for now based on current implementation.
# ActionFactory handles creation from dict (deserialization).
# Individual actions handle conversion to dict (serialization).
