"""Error Handling module for AutoQliq workflows.

This module defines strategies and utilities for handling errors
that occur during workflow execution.

Note: This is currently a placeholder. Error handling logic is primarily
within the WorkflowRunner's execution loop for now. This module could
be expanded to include more sophisticated error handling strategies,
such as retry mechanisms, specific error reporting, or configurable
error responses (e.g., stop vs. continue on failure).
