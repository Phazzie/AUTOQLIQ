# Archived Files

This directory contains non-essential files that have been moved from the main project directory to keep the codebase clean and organized.

## Directory Structure

- **scripts/**: Utility scripts for packaging, exporting, archiving, and other maintenance tasks
- **logs/**: Log files generated by the application
- **docs/**: Archived documentation files
- **temp/**: Temporary files, old versions, and other non-essential files

## Purpose

These files are kept for reference but are not part of the core application. They may be useful for:

1. Understanding the project history
2. Recovering old code or documentation
3. Running utility scripts when needed

## Usage

If you need to use any of these files, you can copy them back to the main project directory or run them directly from this location.

**Note**: The original files have been copied here, not moved. If you want to clean up the main project directory, you should manually delete the original files after verifying that they have been properly archived here.
