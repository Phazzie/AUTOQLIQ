# AutoQliq Project Summary

**********ARCHIVED**********
Archived on: 2025-04-06


## Overview

AutoQliq is a desktop application for web automation, built using Python with Tkinter for the UI. The application follows a layered architecture and adheres to SOLID, KISS, DRY, and TDD principles.

## Architecture

The application is structured into the following layers:

1. **Core Layer**: Domain model, interfaces, actions, workflow logic
2. **Infrastructure Layer**: WebDrivers, persistence, repositories
3. **Application Layer**: Services orchestrating use cases
4. **UI Layer**: Views, presenters following MVP pattern
5. **Tests**: Unit and integration tests

## Implemented Features

### Core Layer
- **Interfaces**: Defined core abstractions (`IWebDriver`, `IAction`, `IWorkflowRepository`, `ICredentialRepository`, `IService`)
- **Entities**: Implemented core data structures (`Credential`, `ActionResult`, `Workflow`)
- **Actions**: Created action classes (`NavigateAction`, `ClickAction`, `TypeAction`, `WaitAction`, `ScreenshotAction`)
- **Action Factory**: Implemented for deserializing action data
- **Workflow Runner**: Handles sequential execution of actions
- **Custom Exceptions**: Structured error handling hierarchy

### Infrastructure Layer
- **Persistence**:
  - File System repositories for workflows and credentials (JSON format)
  - Database repositories using SQLite
  - Repository factory for creating instances based on configuration
- **WebDriver**:
  - `SeleniumWebDriver` implementation
  - `BrowserType` enum
  - `WebDriverFactory` for instantiating drivers
  - Placeholder for `PlaywrightDriver`
- **Common Utilities**:
  - Database connections
  - Error handling decorators
  - Logging utilities
  - Data validation

### Application Layer
- **Service Interfaces**: Defined in `src/core/interfaces/service.py`
- **Service Implementations**:
  - `WorkflowService`: Orchestrates workflow operations
  - `CredentialService`: Handles credential operations with password hashing
  - `WebDriverService`: Manages WebDriver creation and disposal
  - `SchedulerService`: Placeholder for scheduling functionality
  - `ReportingService`: Placeholder for reporting functionality

### UI Layer (MVP)
- **Base Classes**: `BaseView` and `BasePresenter`
- **Views**:
  - `WorkflowEditorView`: For creating and editing workflows
  - `WorkflowRunnerView`: For executing workflows
- **Presenters**:
  - `WorkflowEditorPresenter`: Handles workflow editing logic
  - `WorkflowRunnerPresenter`: Manages workflow execution with threading
- **Components**:
  - `StatusBar`: Provides user feedback
  - `UIFactory`: Creates consistent widgets

### Configuration
- `config.ini`: External settings for repositories, logging, UI
- `config.py`: Loads and provides typed access to settings

### Security
- Password hashing using werkzeug.security

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Core actions
  - Workflow runner
  - File system repositories
  - Database repositories
  - Application services
  - UI presenters
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Database repositories using in-memory SQLite

## Missing/Incomplete Features

Based on the error log from processing gemini5.txt, the following features were planned but not fully implemented:

1. **Advanced Action Types**:
   - `ConditionalAction` (If/Else based on element presence)
   - `LoopAction` (simple fixed count iteration)

2. **UI Dialogs**:
   - Action editor dialog
   - Credential manager dialog
   - Settings view and presenter

3. **Testing**:
   - WebDriver integration tests
   - Tests for new action types

## Next Steps

To complete the project according to the ambitious plan, the following steps are needed:

1. Implement the missing advanced action types
2. Create the UI dialogs for action editing and credential management
3. Add settings view and presenter
4. Implement WebDriver integration tests
5. Add tests for the new action types

## Conclusion

The AutoQliq project has made significant progress in establishing a robust architecture following SOLID principles. The core functionality for basic web automation is in place, with a clean separation of concerns between layers. The application supports both file system and database storage, has a responsive UI with background threading for workflow execution, and includes security features like password hashing.

The next phase of development will focus on enhancing the application with advanced features like conditional actions and loops, improving the user experience with dedicated dialogs, and ensuring comprehensive test coverage.
