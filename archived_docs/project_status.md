Archived on: 2025-04-06


## Overview

This document tracks the implementation and refactoring progress of the AutoQliq project. It combines the previous tracking from `progress.md` and `refactor.md` into a single comprehensive document.

**Note:** Phase 1 (Core Domain Model) has been completed and archived in `progress_phase1_archived.md`.

**Archive Note:** Previous tracking documents have been archived in `docs/archived/progress_archived.md` and `docs/archived/refactor_archived.md`.

## Current State (Updated: April 6, 2025)

AutoQliq has evolved into a robust web automation application with a clean architecture and comprehensive feature set. The project has made significant progress with the implementation of advanced actions, UI dialogs, and settings management.

### Recent Developments

#### Advanced Core Actions

We've significantly enhanced the automation capabilities by implementing:

- **ConditionalAction**: Allows for branching execution based on element presence or variable values

  - Supports if/else logic with separate action lists for each branch
  - Configurable element selector and timeout
  - Supports variable comparison with `variable_name` and `expected_value` parameters
  - Fully integrated with ActionFactory for serialization/deserialization
  - Enhanced with context support for future condition types

- **LoopAction**: Enables repeated execution of actions

  - Supports fixed-count iteration with `iterations` parameter
  - Supports list iteration with `list_variable_name` parameter
  - Contains a nested list of actions to execute in each iteration
  - Fully integrated with ActionFactory
  - Passes loop context (index, iteration, current item) to nested actions
  - Structure in place for future loop types (while loops)

- **ErrorHandlingAction**: Provides try/catch/finally-like error handling

  - Contains separate action lists for try, catch, and finally blocks
  - Executes catch actions only when try actions fail
  - Always executes finally actions
  - Fully integrated with ActionFactory

- **TemplateAction**: Enables reuse of common action patterns

  - References a named template of actions
  - Templates are stored in the workflow repository
  - WorkflowRunner expands templates during execution
  - Fully integrated with ActionFactory

- **Execution Context**: Added a context dictionary to all actions
  - Allows actions to share data during execution
  - Enables more complex workflows with data dependencies
  - Supports variables and dynamic behavior

These advanced actions dramatically increase the power and flexibility of automation workflows, allowing for more complex scenarios like form validation, data extraction with pagination, conditional navigation, and robust error handling.

#### UI Enhancements

We've introduced several key UI components:

- **ActionEditorDialog**: A dynamic dialog for editing all action types

  - Replaces the previous simplistic prompts
  - Dynamically generates appropriate fields based on action type
  - Supports validation of inputs with improved error feedback
  - Catches and displays validation errors from action validation
  - Handles complex nested actions (for Conditional and Loop)

- **CredentialManagerDialog**: A dedicated dialog for credential management

  - Lists existing credentials
  - Allows adding new credentials (with secure password hashing)
  - Supports deleting credentials
  - Integrates with CredentialService for security

- **Settings View/Presenter**: A new tab for application configuration
  - Provides UI for all configurable settings
  - Supports file/directory path browsing
  - Saves changes to config.ini
  - Implements validation and error handling

#### Configuration System

We've enhanced the configuration system with:

- **Save Methods**: Added support for saving configuration changes
- **Improved Robustness**: Better handling of defaults and error conditions
- **UI Integration**: Full integration with the Settings view

#### Workflow Runner

We've significantly enhanced the workflow runner:

- **Context Management**: Added support for a shared execution context
  - Allows actions to share data during execution
  - Enables more complex workflows with data dependencies
  - Supports variables and dynamic behavior
- **Advanced Flow Control**: Enhanced to handle the execution flow of:
  - ConditionalAction with branching logic and variable conditions
  - LoopAction with iteration, list processing, and context passing
  - ErrorHandlingAction with try/catch/finally blocks
  - TemplateAction with template expansion from repository
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better handling of exceptions during workflow execution
- **Enhanced Stop Mechanism**: More responsive stopping by checking stop event before each action

#### Service Layer

We've expanded the service layer with:

- **Enhanced Existing Services**: Improved CredentialService, WorkflowService, and WebDriverService
- **Scheduler Service**:
  - Enhanced the ISchedulerService interface with more detailed methods
  - Implemented a basic SchedulerService using APScheduler
  - Added support for scheduling workflows at specific times or intervals
  - Prepared for future integration with workflow execution
- **Reporting Service**:
  - Enhanced the IReportingService interface
  - Implemented a basic ReportingService stub
  - Prepared for future implementation of execution reporting

## Why We're Refactoring

The AutoQliq codebase has grown organically, leading to several architectural issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Violation of Single Responsibility Principle**: Many modules handle multiple concerns, making the code difficult to maintain and test.
2. **Tight Coupling**: Components are tightly coupled, making it difficult to replace or extend functionality.
3. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Error handling is inconsistent across the codebase.
4. **Limited Testability**: The current architecture makes it difficult to write comprehensive tests.
5. **Poor Separation of Concerns**: The layers of the application (UI, domain, infrastructure) are not clearly separated.

The goal of this refactoring is to create a clean, maintainable, and extensible codebase that follows SOLID principles, is easy to understand (KISS), and avoids duplication (DRY).

## Principles Compliance Tracking

### TDD Compliance

- [ ] All components follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- [ ] Tests are written before implementation code
- [ ] Tests verify behavior, not implementation details
- [ ] Refactoring is performed after tests pass
- [ ] Test coverage exceeds 90% for all components

### SOLID Compliance

- [ ] **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has only one reason to change
- [ ] **Open/Closed Principle**: Components are extendable without modification
- [ ] **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes are substitutable for their base types
- [ ] **Interface Segregation Principle**: Interfaces are client-specific, not general-purpose
- [ ] **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules depend on abstractions

### KISS Compliance

- [ ] All implementations use the simplest possible solution
- [ ] No premature optimization or unnecessary complexity
- [ ] Clear, straightforward naming conventions
- [ ] Methods are short and focused (â‰¤20 lines)
- [ ] Classes have minimal responsibilities

### DRY Compliance

- [ ] No duplicated code across components
- [ ] Shared functionality is extracted to common utilities
- [ ] Inheritance and composition are used appropriately
- [ ] Single source of truth for all concepts
- [ ] Configuration is centralized

### Honest and Fair Grading

**IMPORTANT**: All compliance evaluations must be honest and fair. Never claim compliance when violations exist. Each component should be evaluated against all principles with specific metrics:

- File sizes (flag files exceeding 200 lines)
- Method lengths (flag methods exceeding 20 lines)
- Class responsibilities (flag classes with more than one primary responsibility)
- Interface cohesion (flag interfaces with unrelated methods)

## Detailed Compliance Analysis

### SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:

   - **UI Layer**: 8/10 - Views and presenters have clear responsibilities, but some methods still do too much.
   - **Infrastructure Layer**: 6/10 - Repositories are better structured, but still handle too many concerns (serialization, validation, storage).
   - **Domain Layer**: 7/10 - Action classes are now separated by type, but some still handle multiple concerns.
   - **Application Layer**: 5/10 - Service classes need further refactoring to separate concerns.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:

   - **UI Layer**: 7/10 - Components can be extended, but some concrete dependencies remain.
   - **Infrastructure Layer**: 5/10 - New repository types can be added, but internal methods often need modification.
   - **Domain Layer**: 6/10 - Action hierarchy is extensible, but some base classes need modification for new features.
   - **Application Layer**: 5/10 - Services need better abstraction to allow extension without modification.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:

   - **UI Layer**: 8/10 - Subclasses generally respect contracts, but some assumptions about implementation details exist.
   - **Infrastructure Layer**: 7/10 - Repository interfaces are consistent, but some implementations add constraints.
   - **Domain Layer**: 7/10 - Action subclasses are substitutable, but some edge cases exist.
   - **Application Layer**: 6/10 - Service implementations sometimes violate interface contracts.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:

   - **UI Layer**: 6/10 - Some interfaces are too broad, forcing implementations to provide unnecessary methods.
   - **Infrastructure Layer**: 5/10 - Repository interfaces include methods that not all implementations need.
   - **Domain Layer**: 7/10 - Action interfaces are focused, but some could be further segregated.
   - **Application Layer**: 5/10 - Service interfaces need to be split into more focused interfaces.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - **UI Layer**: 7/10 - Presenters depend on abstractions, but some concrete dependencies remain.
   - **Infrastructure Layer**: 6/10 - Repositories depend on abstractions, but still have concrete dependencies.
   - **Domain Layer**: 7/10 - Actions depend on abstractions, but some concrete dependencies exist.
   - **Application Layer**: 5/10 - Services need better dependency injection.

### KISS Principle

1. **UI Layer**: 6/10

   - Some methods are still complex and difficult to understand
   - Error handling logic is sometimes convoluted
   - View creation and management is overly complex

2. **Infrastructure Layer**: 5/10

   - Repository implementations have complex error handling
   - Serialization logic is spread across multiple classes
   - Database operations are more complex than necessary

3. **Domain Layer**: 6/10

   - Some action classes have complex execution logic
   - Workflow runner has complex error handling
   - Credential management could be simplified

4. **Application Layer**: 5/10
   - Service implementations are often too complex
   - Configuration management needs simplification
   - Error handling patterns are inconsistent

### DRY Principle

1. **UI Layer**: 7/10

   - Common patterns are extracted to base classes
   - Some duplication remains in error handling and event management
   - View creation logic is duplicated across view classes

2. **Infrastructure Layer**: 6/10

   - Common repository operations are in base classes
   - Serialization logic is still partially duplicated
   - Error handling patterns are inconsistent

3. **Domain Layer**: 7/10

   - Common action behavior is in base classes
   - Some duplication in validation logic
   - Error handling could be more consistent

4. **Application Layer**: 5/10
   - Service implementations have duplicated patterns
   - Configuration handling has duplication
   - Error handling is inconsistent
