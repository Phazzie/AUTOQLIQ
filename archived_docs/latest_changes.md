# AutoQliq Latest Changes

**********ARCHIVED**********
Archived on: 2025-04-06


## Overview

This document summarizes the latest changes made to the AutoQliq project, focusing on the enhancement of core actions with variable conditions and list iteration, the implementation of template actions, and improvements to the UI and workflow runner.

## Core Layer Enhancements

### 1. ErrorHandlingAction

We've implemented a new action type that provides try/catch/finally-like error handling:

- Contains separate action lists for try, catch, and finally blocks
- Executes catch actions only when try actions fail
- Always executes finally actions
- Fully integrated with ActionFactory

This action type significantly enhances the robustness of workflows by allowing for proper error handling and recovery.

### 2. Context Management

We've added context management to all actions:

- Modified the IAction interface to include an optional context parameter
- Updated all existing actions to support context passing
- Enhanced the workflow runner to manage a shared execution context
- Added support for context-aware execution in advanced actions

This enables more complex workflows with data dependencies and supports variables and dynamic behavior.

### 3. Enhanced ConditionalAction

We've enhanced the ConditionalAction with variable comparison:

- Added `variable_name` and `expected_value` parameters
- Implemented `'variable_equals'` condition type
- Added logic to check `context[variable_name] == expected_value`
- Updated validation to ensure required parameters are provided
- Improved serialization/deserialization with `to_dict`/`from_dict`
- Added structure for future condition types (JavaScript, regex)

### 4. Enhanced LoopAction

We've enhanced the LoopAction with list iteration:

- Added `list_variable_name` parameter
- Added `'for_each'` loop type
- Implemented logic to iterate over `context[list_variable_name]`
- Added current item to context as `loop_item` for nested actions
- Updated validation to ensure required parameters are provided
- Improved serialization/deserialization with `to_dict`/`from_dict`
- Added structure for future loop types (while loops)

### 5. TemplateAction

We've implemented a new action type for reusable action patterns:

- Created `TemplateAction` class that holds a `template_name`
- Added template methods to `IWorkflowRepository` interface
- Implemented file-based template storage in `FileSystemWorkflowRepository`
- Added database schema for template storage in `DatabaseWorkflowRepository`
- Enhanced `WorkflowRunner` to expand templates during execution
- Fully integrated with `ActionFactory`

### 6. Workflow Runner Enhancements

We've significantly enhanced the workflow runner:

- Added context management during workflow execution
- Added template expansion during execution
- Enhanced flow control for advanced actions
- Improved error handling during workflow execution
- Added support for nested action execution
- Enhanced stop mechanism to check before each action

## Service Layer Enhancements

### 1. Scheduler Service

We've enhanced the scheduler service:

- Updated the ISchedulerService interface with more detailed methods
- Implemented a basic SchedulerService using APScheduler
- Added support for scheduling workflows at specific times or intervals
- Prepared for future integration with workflow execution

### 2. Reporting Service

We've enhanced the reporting service:

- Updated the IReportingService interface
- Implemented a basic ReportingService stub
- Prepared for future implementation of execution reporting

## Testing Enhancements

We've added comprehensive tests for the new features:

- Created tests for ErrorHandlingAction
- Updated tests for ConditionalAction and LoopAction to support context
- Enhanced workflow runner tests to verify context management
- Added tests for advanced flow control

## UI Enhancements

### 1. ActionEditorDialog

We've improved the ActionEditorDialog with better validation feedback:

- Added specific `try...except ValidationError` block around validation
- Added user-friendly error messages using `messagebox.showerror`
- Improved display of validation failures from action's `validate` method
- Enhanced error handling during action creation

## Dependencies

We've added a new dependency:

- APScheduler: For scheduling workflow execution

## Next Steps

The next steps in the project are:

1. Implement JavaScript evaluation for conditions
2. Implement while loops with dynamic conditions
3. Create UI for template management
4. Implement full database template repository
5. Complete the scheduler and reporting service implementations
6. Begin work on the visual workflow designer

These changes have significantly enhanced the power and flexibility of AutoQliq, enabling more complex automation scenarios with variable conditions, list iteration, and reusable templates. The improved error handling and validation feedback also make the application more user-friendly and robust.
