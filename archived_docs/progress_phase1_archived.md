# AutoQliq Implementation Progress Checklist

## Phase 1: Core Domain Model

This checklist tracks the implementation progress of the Core Domain Model phase, strictly adhering to Test-Driven Development (TDD), SOLID principles, Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS), and Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) methodologies.

### Principles Compliance Tracking

#### TDD Compliance

- [x] All components follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- [x] Tests are written before implementation code
- [x] Tests verify behavior, not implementation details
- [x] Refactoring is performed after tests pass
- [x] Test coverage exceeds 90% for all components

#### SOLID Compliance

- [x] **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has only one reason to change
- [x] **Open/Closed Principle**: Components are extendable without modification
- [x] **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes are substitutable for their base types
- [x] **Interface Segregation Principle**: Interfaces are client-specific, not general-purpose
- [x] **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules depend on abstractions

#### KISS Compliance

- [x] No premature optimization or unnecessary complexity
- [x] Clear, straightforward naming conventions
