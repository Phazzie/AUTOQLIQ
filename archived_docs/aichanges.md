# Comprehensive Summary of AutoQliq Development

**********ARCHIVED**********
Archived on: 2025-04-06


## Project Foundation & Architecture

We established a layered architecture for AutoQliq, a desktop application for web automation using Python with Tkinter for the UI. The development process followed Clean Code principles (SOLID, KISS, DRY) with a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

The architecture consists of:
- **Core Layer**: Domain logic, interfaces
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns (webdrivers, persistence)
- **Application Layer**: Services orchestrating use cases
- **UI Layer**: Views, presenters
- **Tests**: Unit and integration tests

Development tooling scripts were created to manage codebase packaging and application:
- `package_project_files.py`
- `apply_packaged_codebase_enhanced.py`
- `apply_gemini_format.py`
- `convert_gemini_format.py`

## Core Layer Implementation

### Interfaces
Defined core abstractions in `src/core/interfaces/` to enforce contracts and enable dependency inversion:
- `IWebDriver`
- `IAction`
- `IWorkflowRepository`
- `ICredentialRepository`
- `IService`

### Entities
Implemented core data structures:
- `Credential` (dataclass)
- `ActionResult` (enum and class)
- `Workflow` (holding actions)

### Actions
Created an `ActionBase` abstract class and implemented concrete actions:
- `NavigateAction`
- `ClickAction`
- `TypeAction` (refined to handle both literal text and credential lookups)
- `WaitAction`
- `ScreenshotAction`

These were initially in `src/core/actions.py` and later refactored into separate modules within `src/core/actions/`.

### Action Factory
Implemented `ActionFactory` to deserialize action data (dictionaries) into action objects based on a registered type mapping.

### Workflow Runner
Implemented `WorkflowRunner` in `src/core/workflow/runner.py` responsible for:
- Iterating through a list of `IAction` objects
- Executing them sequentially
- Handling basic success/failure flow
- Passing necessary context (like `ICredentialRepository`) to actions

### Custom Exceptions
Defined a hierarchy of custom exceptions in `src/core/exceptions.py` for structured error handling:
- `AutoQliqError`
- `WorkflowError`
- `ActionError`
- `RepositoryError`
- `CredentialError`
- `WebDriverError`
- `ValidationError`
- `SerializationError`
- `ConfigError`
- `UIError`

## Infrastructure Layer Implementation

### Persistence
Implemented multiple storage options:

**File System Persistence**:
- `FileSystemWorkflowRepository`
- `FileSystemCredentialRepository`
- Storing data in JSON format

**Database Persistence**:
- `DatabaseWorkflowRepository`
- `DatabaseCredentialRepository`
- Using SQLite, storing actions as JSON within the DB

**Base Classes**:
- `Repository`
- `FileSystemRepository`
- `DatabaseRepository`
- Encapsulating common logic (logging, validation, file/DB operations)

**Factory**:
- `RepositoryFactory` to create repository instances based on configuration type

### WebDriver
- Implemented `SeleniumWebDriver` wrapping the selenium library
- Defined `BrowserType` enum
- Created `WebDriverFactory` to instantiate specific driver implementations
- Included placeholder for `PlaywrightDriver`

### Common Utilities
Added utilities for:
- Database connections (`ConnectionManager`)
- Error handling (`@handle_exceptions`)
- Logging (`@log_method_call`, `LoggerFactory`)
- Data validation (`EntityValidator`, `CredentialValidator`, `WorkflowValidator`)

### Security
- Introduced password hashing using `werkzeug.security` within the `CredentialService` layer
- Ensured passwords are not stored in plain text
- Added `werkzeug` to `requirements.txt`

## Application Layer Implementation

### Interfaces
Defined service interfaces in `src/core/interfaces/service.py`:
- `IWorkflowService`
- `ICredentialService`
- `IWebDriverService`

### Services
Created service implementations in `src/application/services/`:
- `WorkflowService`
- `CredentialService`
- `WebDriverService`

These services depend on repository/factory interfaces and orchestrate use cases (e.g., `WorkflowService.run_workflow` handles driver creation/disposal).

## UI Layer Implementation (MVP)

### Pattern
Established a Model-View-Presenter pattern.

### Base Classes
- Created `BaseView` (integrating `StatusBar`)
- Created `BasePresenter` providing common functionality, logging, and error handling

### Views
Implemented views using Tkinter/ttk widgets:
- `WorkflowEditorView`
- `WorkflowRunnerView`

Views are designed to be passive, displaying data and forwarding user events to the presenter.

### Presenters
Implemented presenters containing UI logic:
- `WorkflowEditorPresenter`
- `WorkflowRunnerPresenter`

Presenters interact with Application Service interfaces, manage view state, and handle user actions.

### Threading
- Implemented background execution for `run_workflow` in `WorkflowRunnerPresenter` using `threading.Thread`
- Prevents UI freezing with safe UI updates scheduled via `view.widget.after()`

### Interfaces
Defined interfaces to enforce contracts:
- `IView`/`IPresenter`
- Specific interfaces for editor/runner components

### Components/Factories
- Used `UIFactory` for consistent widget creation
- Added a `StatusBar` component

## Configuration

- Introduced `config.ini` for external settings (logging, repository type/paths, WebDriver defaults)
- Implemented `config.py` using `configparser` to load and provide typed access to settings

## Testing

### Strategy
Emphasized TDD where feasible, adding Unit and basic Integration tests.

### Unit Tests
Created tests for:
- Core Actions (`test_actions.py`)
- Workflow Runner (`test_workflow.py`)
- File System Repositories (`test_persistence.py`)
- Database Repositories (`test_database_*.py` - mocking DB)
- Application Services (`test_credential_service.py`, `test_workflow_service.py` - mocking repos)
- UI Presenters (`test_editor_presenter.py`, `test_runner_presenter.py` - mocking services/view)

### Integration Tests
- Added basic tests for Database Repositories using an in-memory SQLite DB (`test_database_repository_integration.py`)
- Added placeholder for workflow execution

### Mocking
Utilized `unittest.mock` extensively (patching, `MagicMock`, `mock_open`) to isolate components during unit testing.

## Documentation

- Updated `README.md` with structure, setup, usage, configuration details
- Added initial core documentation (`entities.md`, `exceptions.md`, `interfaces.md`)

## Summary

We have built the foundational structure of a functional MVP application that:
- Supports core web automation actions
- Allows creating/editing/saving workflows to either the file system or a database
- Includes basic credential security (hashing)
- Runs workflows in the background without freezing the UI
- Has a comprehensive suite of unit tests for key components
- Follows SOLID principles with proper separation of concerns
- Provides configuration flexibility
- Implements secure credential handling

The application architecture is now well-structured, maintainable, and ready for further feature development.
