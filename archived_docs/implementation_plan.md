**********ARCHIVED**********
Archived on: 2025-04-06


## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the next phases of the AutoQliq project. It focuses on the remaining work to be done, prioritized by importance and logical grouping.

## Current Status

The project has made significant progress with the implementation of:

1. **Advanced Core Actions**:

   - ConditionalAction with element presence and variable comparison
   - LoopAction with fixed-count and list iteration
   - ErrorHandlingAction with try/catch/finally logic
   - TemplateAction for reusable action patterns
   - Rich context management for all actions

2. **Enhanced Workflow Runner**:

   - Context management during execution
   - Template expansion during execution
   - Advanced flow control for complex actions
   - Improved error handling
   - More responsive stop mechanism

3. **Repository Layer**:

   - Template management in IWorkflowRepository
   - File-based template storage implementation
   - Database schema for template storage

4. **Service Layer**:

   - Basic SchedulerService with APScheduler integration
   - ReportingService interface and stub
   - Enhanced workflow service for templates and context

5. **UI Components**:
   - ActionEditorDialog with improved validation feedback
   - CredentialManagerDialog for managing credentials
   - Settings View/Presenter for configuration management

## Implementation Timeline

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)

- Implement JavaScript evaluation for conditions
- Implement while loops with dynamic conditions
- Create UI for template management
- Implement full database template repository

### Medium-term (3-4 weeks)

- Complete scheduler service implementation
- Complete reporting service implementation
- Begin work on visual workflow designer
- Implement workflow versioning

### Long-term (5+ weeks)

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a roadmap for the continued development of AutoQliq. By following this plan, we will systematically enhance the application's capabilities while maintaining a clean, maintainable, and extensible codebase that follows SOLID principles, is easy to understand (KISS), and avoids duplication (DRY).
