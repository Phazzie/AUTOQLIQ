# GitHub Copilot Instruction Evaluation Rubric

## 10-Category Evaluation Framework (1-10 points each)

1. **Adherence Likelihood** - How likely Copilot is to follow the instruction

   - 1: Impossible to follow consistently
   - 10: Can be reliably enforced in all generated code

2. **Value-Add Factor** - How much better the whole instruction set is with this line included

   - 1: No discernible improvement
   - 10: Transformative impact on overall quality

3. **Wins Over Replacement (WOR)** - Improvement over standard/baseline instruction

   - 1: Significantly worse than standard practice
   - 10: Revolutionary improvement over standard approach

4. **Clarity & Precision** - How unambiguous and specific the instruction is

   - 1: Vague or contradictory
   - 10: Crystal clear with no room for misinterpretation

5. **Technical Soundness** - Alignment with established engineering principles

   - 1: Promotes anti-patterns or outdated practices
   - 10: Represents industry best practices

6. **Measurability** - How objectively verifiable compliance is

   - 1: Purely subjective assessment
   - 10: Can be verified programmatically or with clear metrics

7. **Contextual Adaptability** - How well it applies across different languages/projects

   - 1: Only applicable to specific narrow cases
   - 10: Universal principle adaptable to any codebase

8. **Implementation Efficiency** - Impact on development speed

   - 1: Significantly slows development
   - 10: Accelerates development while maintaining quality

9. **Maintenance Value** - Long-term impact on code maintainability

   - 1: Creates maintenance burdens
   - 10: Dramatically reduces maintenance costs

10. **Educational Value** - How much it improves developer knowledge
    - 1: Reinforces bad practices
    - 10: Teaches valuable principles that improve skills
