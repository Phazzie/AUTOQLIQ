# AutoQliq Implementation Progress Checklist

## Current Status

This document tracks the implementation progress of the AutoQliq application. The project is currently in Phase 3 (Integration and UI Implementation), with Phase 1 (Core Domain Model) and Phase 2 (Infrastructure Layer Implementation) completed.

### Completed Components

- Core domain entities (Workflow, Credentials, ActionResult)
- Basic action implementations (Navigate, Click, Type)
- Advanced action implementations (Conditional, Loop, ErrorHandling, Template)
- Core interfaces (IAction, IWebDriver, IRepository)
- Basic workflow execution logic
- WebDriver implementation (Selenium wrapper)
- Repository implementations (FileSystem, Database)
- UI components (WorkflowEditor, WorkflowRunner, SettingsView)
- Presenters (WorkflowEditor, WorkflowRunner, SettingsPresenter)
- Integration between all components
- Error handling and validation

### In Progress Components

- Enhanced UI components (Visualization, Drag-and-drop editor)
- Advanced reporting features
- Scheduler implementation
- Performance optimizations
- Comprehensive documentation

### Next Steps

1. Implement workflow visualization features
2. Create drag-and-drop workflow editor
3. Enhance reporting capabilities
4. Implement scheduler for automated execution
5. Optimize performance for large workflows
6. Complete comprehensive documentation
7. Add more test coverage
8. Implement Playwright WebDriver alternative

## Known Issues/Bugs

- WebDriver initialization fails on some Linux distributions
- Credential encryption not yet implemented for file-based storage
- UI may freeze during long-running workflow execution
- Error handling for network failures needs improvement
- Template actions don't properly handle missing context variables
- Conditional actions have inconsistent evaluation behavior
- Workflow visualization not yet implemented
- Drag-and-drop editor not yet available
- Limited reporting capabilities
- No scheduling functionality yet

## Implementation Principles

All development strictly adheres to:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - avoid unnecessary complexity
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself - eliminate duplication

## Definition of Done

A component is considered complete when:

1. All tests pass with >90% code coverage
2. Code adheres to SOLID, KISS, and DRY principles
3. Documentation is complete and accurate
4. Code review has been completed and feedback addressed
5. Integration tests verify the component works correctly with other components
