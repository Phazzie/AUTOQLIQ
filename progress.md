# AutoQliq Implementation Progress Checklist

## Current Status

This document tracks the implementation progress of the AutoQliq application. The project is currently in Phase 2 (Infrastructure Layer Implementation), with Phase 1 (Core Domain Model) completed.

### Completed Components

- Core domain entities (Workflow, Credentials, ActionResult)
- Basic action implementations (Navigate, Click, Type)
- Core interfaces (IAction, IWebDriver, IRepository)
- Basic workflow execution logic

### In Progress Components

- WebDriver implementation (Selenium wrapper)
- Repository implementations (FileSystem, Database)
- UI components (WorkflowEditor, WorkflowRunner)
- Presenters (WorkflowEditor, WorkflowRunner)

### Next Steps

1. Complete WebDriver implementation
2. Implement repository classes
3. Develop UI components
4. Implement presenters
5. Write integration tests
6. Create documentation

## Known Issues/Bugs

- WebDriver initialization fails on some Linux distributions
- Credential encryption not yet implemented for file-based storage
- UI freezes during long-running workflow execution
- Error handling for network failures needs improvement
- Template actions don't properly handle missing context variables
- Conditional actions have inconsistent evaluation behavior

## Implementation Principles

All development strictly adheres to:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - avoid unnecessary complexity
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself - eliminate duplication

## Definition of Done

A component is considered complete when:

1. All tests pass with >90% code coverage
2. Code adheres to SOLID, KISS, and DRY principles
3. Documentation is complete and accurate
4. Code review has been completed and feedback addressed
5. Integration tests verify the component works correctly with other components
